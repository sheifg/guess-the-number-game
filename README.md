## **Guess the number**

### *Project Description:*

The task of this project is to create a guess the number game (between 1 to 100).

### *Problem Statement:*
- Each time the application is opened, it will keep a random number between 1-100 in the background.
- The user makes a guess.
- The number is compared and guided up/down until the user guess the correct number.
- For example:
    - If the number is 65 and user guessed "20" the first time.
    - Prompt the user to "Enter a number between 20 and 100".
    - If the user guessed 80 on the second guess, this time it should prompt "Enter a number between          20 (the lowest guess closest to the number) to 80 (the closest big guess to the number)".

### *Project Objectives:*

At the end of the project, following topics are to be covered:
- HTML
